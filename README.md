Repository for the modified.logistic package. This package provides tools for fitting and plotting a generalized logistic epidemic model, as well as some data smoothing tools. For details of the model see the paper in pdf attached. In this repository you can also find data from the first months of the COVID-19 outbreak which was used for fitting the model in the paper attached. 

The data comes from the Worldometers website: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/. For an easy way of loading the data from the Worldometers website you can go to my repository: https://github.com/PIOTRSUDER99/Webscrapping-Worldometers-for-COVID-19-Data and utilize the Python script provided there.

For use, download as a zip file.
